    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baked mac and cheese.  It’s nearly the universal comfort food, and there are SO many variations!  In fact, I almost didn’t post this recipe, as there are SOOOO many mac and cheese recipes available, and most people already have their favorite way of making it.</p>
        <p>Of course, there’s no “right” way or “wrong” way, so I’m here sharing the way I like to make my mac and cheese (the way my family loves it too).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li> 
             <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>  
             <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
             <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li> 
             <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>  
             <li>4 cups shredded medium cheddar cheese</li>
             <li>2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese</li>  
             <li>1/2 Tbsp. salt</li>
             <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li> 
             <li>1/4 tsp. paprika</li>  
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
             <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li> 
             <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt until combined. Set aside.</li>  
             <li>Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (preferred) or a hand mixer, beat sugar, oil, eggs, egg whites, and extracts until combined. Add the sour cream and beat until combined. Add half of the flour mixture, beating until just combined. While still beating, slowly add milk, then the remaining flour mixture. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Be careful not to overmix it.</li>
             <li>Line three 8-inch cake pans** with parchment paper and grease the pans. Evenly divide the batter between the three pans. Tap/gently drop the pans on the countertop a couple times to remove any air bubbles.</li> 
             <li>Bake for 18-22 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If necessary, rotate the pans once during bake time to ensure even browning. Place the pans on a rack to cool completely.</li>  
        </ol>
